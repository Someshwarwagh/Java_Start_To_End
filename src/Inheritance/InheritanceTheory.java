public class InheritanceTheory {

//	It is a process of aquiiring the properties and behaviours from parent class to child class is called as Inheritance
//	we can perform inheritance with the help of extends keywords
//	Extends keyword represents its relationships
//	Parent class is also called as super class
//	child class is also called as sub class
//	Properties are called as variables 
//	Behaviours are called as Method

//	Incorporsted Members :
//	Child class can access the members of its own class such members are called as Incorporsted Members
	
//	Inhirited Members :
//	Child class can also access the members of its parent class such members are called as Inhirited Members
	
//	
//	Types of Inheritance : 
//		1.Single level Inheritance
//			-Its a process of aquiring properties and behaviours from parent to child class is called as Single level Inheritance
//		2.Multi Level Inheritance
//			-Its a process of aquiring properties and behaviours from more than one level is called as Multi level Inheritance
//		3.Hierarchical Inheritance
//			-A parent class consist of more than one child is called as Hierarchical Inheritance
//		4.Multiple Inheritance
//			-A sub class consist of more than one super class is called as Multiple Inheritance
//			-Multiple inheritance not supports in Java becuase of dimond problem
//			-Because of child class constructor getting confused which parent class constructor has to call hence we get diamond problem 
//		5.Hybrid Inheritance
//			-Its a combination of multiple and hierarchical inheritance
//			-Also Hybrid Inheritance not supports because of same dimond problem
